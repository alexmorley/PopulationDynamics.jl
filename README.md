## To Do
- [ ] Define fit for each method
    - [X] PCAICA
    - [X] PCA
    - [ ] Factor Analysis
    - [ ] Tensor Decompositions (CP)
    - [ ] Cross Correlations
    - [ ] Community Detection
- [ ] Define generalised track
    - [X] For "linear stationary" models
- [ ] Bootstrap for each method
    - [ ] For 2nd order tensors
    - [ ] For 3rd order tensors
- [ ] Document global variable `tempfiledir` for caching results
- [ ] Split EPhys into EPhys Base & spikes/plotrecipes etc.
